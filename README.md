The creator runs entirely in your browser, no files are sent to a server.

This is a 'Hunter: The Reckoning' character creation tool for beginners. It is intentionally streamlined and limited to creating a common type of character following the rules from the source book. You can download your character into a printable PDF when you're done and also save it to a local JSON file that you can load into this web app to continue editing.

This was possible with the groundwork and structure provided by odin_dev

## How to run
